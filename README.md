# My Projects  

This repository serves as a portfolio hub, showcasing my academic and personal projects in algorithms, data structures, and applied software development. 

---

## CS201 — Data Structures and Algorithms  
Projects focused on implementing core data structures and applying them to classical algorithmic problems:
- [Markov Text Generator](https://github.com/ashleywhipple/Markov)  
- [Huffman Compression](https://github.com/ashleywhipple/Huffman)  
- [Routing Service](https://github.com/ashleywhipple/Routing-Service)  

---

## CS330 — Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
A collection of problem-driven algorithm implementations
- [Design of Algorithms](https://github.com/ashleywhipple/Design-of-Algorithms)  
— Includes Java implementations of classic algorithmic techniques such as shortest paths (Bellman-Ford), network flow, greedy interval scheduling, graph connectivity, and dynamic programming.

## Personal Projects  
Independent projects applying algorithms and software engineering to real-world use cases:
- [Stock Analysis Tool](https://github.com/ashleywhipple/StockAnalysis)
- Python-based financial data analysis and visualization tool that uses yfinance for market data and includes technical indicators like moving averages.
